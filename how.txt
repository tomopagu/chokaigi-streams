For the Chokaigi Web App, use Moment.js for the Japanese Times, convert to UTC with .UTC and then convert them using '.local()' into users time.

eg.
var time = moment.utc([jptime]); // Convert the JP time to UTC
time.local(); // Convert the UTC time into the users timezone

{
  name: [stream name],
  time: [jp time],
  link: [link to page (Gate or Watch)]
}

you'll want to angular.forEach that in the controller and replace stream.time with the user's timezone, then you can filter into a nicer date when ngRepeat-ing
